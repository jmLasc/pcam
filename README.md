# *PatchCamelyon* Deep Learning Analysis

Created for the Human & AI Research class. 

# About
This repository is an archive of the notebooks used in evaluating the PatchCamelyon dataset, created by [Veeling et al](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam). This project chiefly tests 3 different architectures, 1) a self-defined convolutional neural net, 2) residual networks, and 3) transformers. 


# Use

The above notebooks are intended to be used in Google CoLab. Note that if you run this on your own workspace, you may need to edit the code to work with the way your Google Drive is organized.

# Data

Data was obtained from [Veeling et al](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam), and was decompressed using 7zip. The resulting archive files were then uploaded to Google Drive.
